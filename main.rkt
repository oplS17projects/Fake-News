-return most of the imporant members in the object in the form of nested list

kgram
-returns all the valid kgrams in the object

freq-kgram
-returns the freq of the kgrams

total
the total number of each kgram

alpha
-returns the all the char in the model

total-char
-return the total number of each char

alpha-freq
-the frequency of the char that follow a kgram

get-the-news
-250 is the numbers of char you want to generate
-this will generate the fake news

please enter one of the symbol that you want to pass in to the model
