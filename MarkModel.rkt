#| how to run this
(define fake-news (MarkovModel "file-name.txt" 7))
7 = order of the model which is the length of kgrams

(fake-news 'obj)
return most of the imporant members in the object in the form of nested list
but you can acces them all indivauly as well with keywords

(fake-news 'kgram)
returns all the valid kgrams in the object

(fake-news 'freq-kgram)
returns the freq of the kgrams

(fake-news 'total)
the total number of each kgram

(fake-news 'alpha)
returns the all the char in the model

(fake-news 'total-char)
return the total number of each char

(fake-news 'alpha-freq)
the frequency of the char that follow a kgram

(fake-news 'order)
returns the order

(fake-news 'news)
returns raw string of the input string

((fake-news 'get-the-news) 250)
250 is the numbers of char you want to generate
this will generate the fake news
